# [Procedural Map Playground](https://aurbano.github.io/procedural-maps/)

Online tool to test different parameters for a 2D procedurally generated map.

It uses WebGL rendering using [Pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) of our Hive game.

[Blog post](https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-08-procedural-maps/) about this.

## Sample Output

The output resolution is also parameterized, for these examples I kept it slightly high to have a more "pixel art" style. Adjusting the colors and adding some variance to them it could be made to feel more realistic though.
